Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary
archives are published at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.13 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```
See [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth#build-go-ethereum-from-source-code) for further info on building MEV-geth from source.

## MEV-Geth: a proof of concept

We have designed and implemented a proof of concept for permissionless MEV extraction called MEV-Geth. It is a sealed-bid block space auction mechanism for communicating transaction order preference. While our proof of concept has incomplete trust guarantees, we believe it's a significant improvement over the status quo. The adoption of MEV-Geth should relieve a lot of the network and chain congestion caused by frontrunning and backrunning bots.

|  **`geth`**   | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options.          |

### Design goals

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

The MEV-Geth proof of concept relies on the fact that searchers can withhold bids from certain miners in order to disincentivize bad behavior like stealing a profitable strategy. We expect a complete privacy design to necessitate some sort of private computation solution like SGX, ZKP, or MPC to withhold the transaction content from miners until it is mined in a block. One of the core objective of the Flashbots organization is to incentivize and produce research in this direction.

The MEV-Geth proof of concept does not provide any finality guarantees. We expect the solution to this problem to require post-trade execution privacy through private chain state or strong economic infeasibility. The design of a system with strong finality is the second core objective of the MEV-Geth research effort.

### How it works

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up `geth`'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/)
   as well as `geth`'s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Görli test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```shell
$ geth --goerli console
```

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1fWz7rcD.png)

The MEV-Geth proof of concept is compatible with any regular Ethereum client. The Flashbots core devs are maintaining [a reference implementation](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth) for the go-ethereum client.

### What is the difference between MEV-Geth and geth

An in-depth list of the changes can be seen by inspecting the [diff](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...flashbots:master#diff-c426ecd2f7d247753b9ea8c1cc003f21fa412661c1f967d203d4edf8163da344R1970). Summary below:

- Modify Geth’s txpool to also contain a `mevBundles` field, which stores a list of MEV bundles. Each MEV bundle is an array of transactions, along with a min/max timestamp for their inclusion.
- A new eth_sendBundle API is exposed which allows adding an MEV Bundle to the txpool. This is called by traders.
  - The transactions submitted to the bundle are “eth_sendRawTransaction-style” RLP encoded signed transactions along with the min/max block of inclusion
  - This API is a no-op when run in light mode
- Geth’s miner is modified as follows:
  - While in the event loop, before adding all the pending txpool “normal” transactions to the block, it:
    - Finds the most profitable bundle
      - It picks the most profitable bundle by returning the one with the highest average gas price per unit of gas
        - computeBundleGas: Returns average gas price (\sum{gasprice_i*gasused_i + (coinbase_after - coinbase_before)) / \sum{gasused_i})
    - Commits the bundle(remember: Bundle transactions are not ordered by nonce or gas price). For each transaction in the bundle, it:
        - `Prepare`’s it against the state
        - CommitsTransaction with trackProfit = true
            w.current.profit += coinbase_after_tx - coinbase_before_tx
            w.current.profit += gas * gas_price
  - If a block is found where the w.current.profit is more than the previous profit, it switches mining to that block.


### How to use as a miner

Miners can start mining MEV blocks by running MEV-Geth or by implementing their own fork that matches the specification.

In order to start receiving bundles from searchers, miners will need to publish a [public https endpoint that exposes the `eth_sendBundle` RPC](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-relay-js).

MEV-Geth is maintained by the Flashbots core dev team and [the source code can be found on github](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth).

#### Patch diff

If you're just interested in seeing the diff as a patch, run the following:
```
git diff -p v1.9.25..origin/release/v1.9.25
```

### How to use as a searcher

A searcher's job is to monitor the Ethereum state and transaction pool for MEV opportunities and produce transaction bundles that extract that MEV. Anyone can become a searcher. In fact, the bundles produced by searchers don't need to extract MEV at all, but we expect the most valuable bundles will. An MEV-Geth bundle is a standard message template composed of an array of valid ethereum transactions, a blockheight, and an optional timestamp range over which the bundle is valid.

This will start `geth` in fast-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints is not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
    "signedTransactions": ['...'], // RLP encoded signed transaction array
    "blocknumber": "0x386526", // hex string
    "minTimestamp": 12345, // optional uint64
    "maxTimestamp": 12345 // optional uint64
}
```

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "balance": "111111111"
  },
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {
    "balance": "222222222"
  }
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`geth` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ geth init path/to/genesis.json
```

#### Creating the rendezvous point

With all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you'll need to
start a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over
the internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:

```shell
$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key
$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key
```

With the bootnode online, it will display an [`enode` URL](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/enode-url-format)
that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to
replace the displayed IP address information (most probably `[::]`) with your externally
accessible IP to get the actual `enode` URL.

*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `geth` node as a bootnode, but it's the less
recommended way.*

#### Starting up your member nodes

With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try
`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent `geth`
node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will
probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so
do also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.

```shell
$ geth --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>
```

*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll
also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*

#### Running a private miner

Mining on the public Ethereum network is a complex task as it's only feasible using GPUs,
requiring an OpenCL or CUDA enabled `ethminer` instance. For information on such a
setup, please consult the [EtherMining subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/)
and the [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) repository.

In a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for
practical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals
without needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple
ones either). To start a `geth` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended
by:

```shell
$ geth <usual-flags> --mine --miner.threads=1 --etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all
proceedings to the account specified by `--etherbase`. You can further tune the mining
by changing the default gas limit blocks converge to (`--targetgaslimit`) and the price
transactions are accepted at (`--gasprice`).

## Contribution

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome contributions
from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to go-ethereum, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request
for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. If you wish to submit
more complex changes though, please check up with the core devs first on [our gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum)
to ensure those changes are in line with the general philosophy of the project and/or get
some early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter as well as our review
and merge procedures quick and simple.

The `blocknumber` defines the block height at which the bundle is to be included. A bundle will only be evaluated for the provided blockheight and immediately evicted if not selected.

The `minTimestamp` and `maxTimestamp` are optional conditions to further restrict bundle validity within a time range.

Please see the [Developers' Guide](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/devguide)
for more details on configuring your environment, managing project dependencies, and
testing procedures.

<img width="544" src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk6iQmr5P.png">

To submit a bundle, the searcher sends the bundle directly to the miner using the rpc method `eth_sendBundle`. Since MEV-Geth requires direct communication between searchers and miners, a searcher can configure the list of miners where they want to send their bundle.

### Moving beyond proof of concept
We provide the MEV-Geth proof of concept as a first milestone on the path to mitigating the negative externalities caused by MEV. We hope to discuss with the community the merits of adopting MEV-Geth in its current form. Our preliminary research indicates it could free at least 2.5% of the current chain congestion by eliminating the use of frontrunning and backrunning and provide uplift of up to 18% on miner rewards from Ethereum. That being said, we believe a sustainable solution to MEV existential risks requires complete privacy and finality, which the proof of concept does not address. We hope to engage community feedback throughout the development of this complete version of MEV-Geth.
